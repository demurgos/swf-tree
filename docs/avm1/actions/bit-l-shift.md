## Original documentation

### ActionBitLShift

ActionBitLShift pops the shift count arg and then value off of the stack. The value argument is converted to 32-
bit signed integer and only the least significant 5 bits are used as the shift count. The bits in the value arg are
shifted to the left by the shift count. ActionBitLShift pushes an S32 number to the stack.
